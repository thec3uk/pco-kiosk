# Planning Center Live Kiosk

This is a simple chrome extension to update Planning Center Services Live to be more readable on large screens and from a distance.

In short it does the following when clicked:

- Open a new window at fullscreen
- Update the page CSS to rearrange items and increase font-size
- Switch the layout to fullscreen

## Todo

- Shift to second screen, if this is possible (test the current code first)
- Open planning center (given a service id or link)
